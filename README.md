# Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

In this project, we will be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors). Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. 

## Getting Started

The code can be run on a jupyter notebook. The data are in csv format. App details from both the Google play store and Ios App store are taken.

The dataset used is:
* [Earnings based on majors](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

####Please make sure to run in the order of the line of codes in you are using a notebook.
